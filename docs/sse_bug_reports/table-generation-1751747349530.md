AUTO PROMPT TO CLAUDE:

Generate a comparison table of 3 different programming languages (choose randomly from Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Go, Rust, Swift, Ruby, PHP, C#) with columns for Language, Type, and Use Case. Include a brief introduction paragraph before the table, then after the table add a some details with **bold** and *italic* formatting explaining your personal recommendation for beginners and why. Use the current timestamp: 1751747310181
