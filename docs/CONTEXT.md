# Rolling Context Document - Firesite Chat Service

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-27 by Claude Code
**Current Phase**: Service Integration Complete - Kanban Ready
**Session Count**: 4

## üéØ Current Mission
**Immediate Goal**: Deploy to Kanban Project Service for AI-assisted project management
**Context**: Revolutionary context-aware chat service with full MCP Max integration and service discovery

## üìç Current Position
### What We Just Completed
- ‚úÖ **MCP Max Integration Restored**: Full connectivity to enhanced MCP server working
- ‚úÖ **Service Discovery**: Dynamic port resolution via @firesite/service-registry
- ‚úÖ **Dual Mode Support**: Seamless switching between MCP Basic and Max modes
- ‚úÖ **Documentation Updates**: README.md and TODO.md updated to reflect integration completion
- ‚úÖ **Code Cleanup**: Removed debug artifacts and old SSE bug reports
- ‚úÖ **Feature Branch**: Created for Kanban integration sprint

### What We're Working On Now
- üîÑ **Kanban Integration Ready**: All infrastructure complete for project management deployment
- üîÑ **Production Readiness**: Service integration testing and final polish

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Deploy chat service to Firesite Project Service environment
2. Integrate with Kanban task creation and management workflows
3. Implement project-specific MMCO context objects
4. Test multi-user collaboration features

## üß† Key Decisions & Learnings
### Architectural Decisions
- **Browser-Based Service Discovery**: Chat service uses discovery, not registration (appropriate for browser clients)
- **MCP Server Manager**: Existing service manager handles port discovery correctly
- **Service Registry Integration**: Uses MCP Basic server as registry API endpoint
- **Context-Aware Architecture**: Perfect foundation for project management context

### User Preferences  
- **Service Integration Focus**: Complete ecosystem connectivity over isolated components
- **Documentation Completeness**: Comprehensive context preservation for handoffs
- **Production Quality**: 95%+ test coverage maintained throughout integration
- **Clean Development**: Feature branches and systematic git practices

## üîó Critical Resources
### Codebase Locations
- **Main Project**: `/Users/thomasbutler/development/Firesite/firesite-chat-service`
- **MCP Max Server**: `/Users/thomasbutler/development/Firesite/firesite-mcp-max`
- **Project Service**: `/Users/thomasbutler/development/Firesite/firesite-project-service` (integration target)

### Integration Points
- **Service Discovery**: @firesite/service-registry for dynamic MCP server discovery
- **MCP Connectivity**: Direct connection to MCP Basic (3001) and Max (3002) servers
- **Context System**: MMCO/UACP/PACP support ready for project contexts
- **Streaming Service**: Revolutionary SSE rendering with 90%+ accuracy

## üöÄ Active Development Threads
### Thread 1: Service Integration Complete
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Full integration with MCP Max and service discovery
**Result**: Chat service works in both Basic and Max modes with dynamic port discovery

### Thread 2: Kanban Project Deployment
**Status**: üîÑ READY TO START  
**Goal**: Deploy chat service within Kanban project management system
**Dependencies**: Service integration (‚úÖ completed)
**Next Actions**:
- Integrate with project management UI
- Implement task-specific conversation contexts
- Add team collaboration features

### Thread 3: Advanced Context Features
**Status**: üìã PLANNED
**Goal**: Enhanced MMCO/UACP/PACP functionality for project management
**Dependencies**: Kanban deployment and testing
**Features**: Project context automation, team member profiles, task context preservation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Constraints
### Current Limitations
- **Production Deployment**: Local development only - need production Firebase configuration
- **Multi-User Features**: Single-user focused - need team collaboration expansion
- **Context Automation**: Manual context entry - need intelligent context suggestion

### Resource Constraints
- **Testing Environment**: Need staging environment for Kanban integration testing
- **Performance**: Large project contexts may need optimization
- **Security**: Production security hardening needed for multi-user deployment

## ü§ù Handoff Protocol
**For Next Claude Instance**:
1. Start by reading this CONTEXT.md
2. Review TODO.md Kanban integration priorities
3. Verify chat service runs: `npm run dev` (port 5173)
4. Check MCP connectivity: Basic (3001) and Max (3002) modes working
5. Check feature branch: `feature/kanban-integration-2025-07-27`
6. Begin Kanban Project Service integration
