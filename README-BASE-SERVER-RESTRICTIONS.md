# Base Server Restrictions Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented Base Server feature restrictions and upgrade prompts to guide users toward MCP Max for advanced features.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Upgrade Modal Component (`/src/components/upgrade-modal.js`)
- **Purpose**: Shows upgrade prompts when users try to access MCP Max features on Base Server
- **Features**:
  - Feature-specific upgrade prompts
  - Server comparison table (Base vs Max)
  - Benefits highlighting
  - Quick setup instructions
  - Automatic server switching

### 2. Connection Toggle Updates (`/src/components/connection-toggle.js`)
- **Enhanced Mode System**: 
  - `mcp-base` (Port 3001) - Basic AI conversations
  - `mcp-max` (Port 3002) - Advanced AI with context objects  
  - `direct` - Direct Anthropic API
- **Server Capabilities Detection**:
  - Dynamic feature availability based on selected server
  - Real-time capability updates via GlobalEvents
  - Helper methods for UI restrictions

### 3. Settings Panel Restrictions (`/src/components/settings-panel.js`)
- **Restricted Features** (MCP Max Only):
  - Specialized AI Modes & Roles with context awareness
  - MMCO Context Objects (project/task context)
  - UACP Business Context (company/product context)
  - PACP Personal Context (individual preferences)
  - Session persistence with context memory
- **Available on Both Servers**:
  - Basic AI conversations
  - Basic system prompts
  - Model selection (Claude 3.7/4 switching)
  - Streaming markdown and code highlighting
- **UI Behavior**:
  - Grayed-out sections with overlays
  - Disabled form elements
  - Feature badges indicating "MCP Max" requirement
  - Upgrade buttons with specific call-to-actions

### 4. Visual Design (`/src/assets/css/feature-restrictions.css`)
- **Restriction Overlays**: Blur effect with upgrade prompts
- **Feature Badges**: Purple gradient badges indicating "MCP Max"
- **Server Comparison**: Side-by-side feature comparison
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layouts
- **Dark Mode Support**: Consistent theming

### 5. App Integration (`/src/app.js`)
- Imported upgrade modal and CSS
- Integrated with existing service architecture
- Event-driven capability updates

## Key Features

### Feature Detection
```javascript
// Server capabilities automatically detected
const capabilities = connectionToggle.getServerCapabilities();
// Returns: { mode, supportsContextObjects, supportsAIModes, etc. }
```

### Dynamic Restrictions
```javascript
// Settings panel automatically restricts features
section.classList.toggle('feature-restricted', !isAllowed);
// Disables form elements and shows upgrade overlays
```

### Upgrade Flow
```javascript
// One-click upgrade to MCP Max
globalEvents.emit('upgrade:switchToMax');
// Automatically switches server and enables features
```

## User Experience

### Base Server (Port 3001)
- ✅ Basic AI conversations
- ✅ Basic system prompts
- ✅ Model selection (Claude 3.7/4)
- ✅ Streaming markdown
- ✅ Code highlighting
- ❌ Context objects (shows upgrade prompt)
- ❌ Specialized AI modes (shows upgrade prompt)
- ❌ Session persistence (shows upgrade prompt)

### MCP Max Server (Port 3002)
- ✅ All Base Server features
- ✅ MMCO/UACP/PACP context objects
- ✅ Specialized AI modes & roles with context
- ✅ AI role-based system prompts
- ✅ Session persistence with context memory
- ✅ Advanced memory capabilities
- ✅ Project-aware conversations

## Integration Points

### Event System
- `connection:capabilitiesChanged` - Server capability updates
- `upgrade:switchToMax` - User-initiated upgrade
- `ui:notification` - Success/error messages

### GlobalEvents Flow
```
User clicks restricted feature
↓
upgradeModal.show(feature)
↓
User clicks "Upgrade to MCP Max"
↓
globalEvents.emit('upgrade:switchToMax')
↓
connectionToggle.switchMode('mcp-max')
↓
Settings panel enables all features
```

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Load application with Base Server selected
- [ ] Verify context sections are grayed out and disabled
- [ ] Click upgrade buttons and verify modal appears
- [ ] Test server switching via upgrade modal
- [ ] Switch to MCP Max - verify features still restricted without auth
- [ ] Enter demo API key "mcp-max-test" in authentication section
- [ ] Verify features become available after authentication
- [ ] Test persistence of authentication across page refreshes
- [ ] Test fallback when MCP Max server unavailable

### Feature Restrictions
- [ ] MMCO section shows restriction overlay
- [ ] UACP section shows restriction overlay  
- [ ] PACP section shows restriction overlay
- [ ] Specialized AI Mode dropdown disabled on Base Server
- [ ] Basic System Prompt textarea available on Base Server
- [ ] Context object sections disabled on Base Server

### Upgrade Modal
- [ ] Modal shows correct feature information
- [ ] Server comparison table displays properly
- [ ] "Upgrade to MCP Max" button works
- [ ] Automatic server switching functions
- [ ] Success notification appears

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Clear Value Proposition**: Users understand what they get with MCP Max
- **Guided Upgrade Path**: Simple one-click upgrade process
- **No Confusion**: Clear visual indicators of feature availability
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Basic features work immediately, advanced features available on demand

### Technical Architecture
- **Clean Separation**: Base vs Max features clearly delineated
- **Event-Driven**: Loose coupling between components
- **Maintainable**: Easy to add new restricted features
- **Scalable**: Can extend to additional server tiers

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Testing**: Validate all restriction and upgrade flows
2. **Documentation**: Update user guides with server differences
3. **Performance**: Ensure restriction checks don't impact UI performance
4. **Accessibility**: Verify screen reader compatibility with overlays

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The Base Server restriction system is fully implemented and ready for testing. Users will now receive clear guidance when attempting to use advanced features, with a smooth upgrade path to MCP Max server.
